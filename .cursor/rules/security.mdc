# Security Guidelines

## Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Implement proper password hashing with bcrypt
- Validate all input data
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting

## Data Protection
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper access controls

## Security Best Practices
- Apply **input validation and sanitization** rigorously, especially on inputs from external sources.
- Use secure defaults for **JWT, cookies**, and configuration settings.
- Isolate sensitive operations with clear **permission boundaries**.
- Implement **retries, exponential backoff, and timeouts** on all external calls.
- Use **circuit breakers and rate limiting** for service protection.
- Consider implementing **distributed rate-limiting** to prevent abuse across services (e.g., using Redis).
