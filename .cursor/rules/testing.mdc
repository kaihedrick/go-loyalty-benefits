# Testing Guidelines

## Unit Tests
- Write tests for all business logic
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use tools like 'go test -cover' to ensure adequate test coverage

## Integration Tests
- Test database operations with test containers
- Test HTTP endpoints with real HTTP requests
- Test Kafka message handling
- Separate **fast unit tests** from slower integration and E2E tests
- Ensure **test coverage** for every exported function, with behavioral checks

## Testing Best Practices
- Use **benchmarks** to track performance regressions and identify bottlenecks.
- Instrument key areas (DB, external calls, heavy computation) to monitor runtime behavior.
- Ensure all behavior is **observable, testable, and documented**.
